#Food-E 

# Technologies Used

1. Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

# User Stories

1. As a User, I like an app that is easy to navigate through. 
2. As a User, I like to know that my information is secure.
3. As a User, I want to have a centralized place to post my food pictures.
4. As a User, I want a website I can go where I can get ideas of new restaurants or food to try next based on pictures and descriptions from other users.   

 # Approach Taken

1. I wanted to create an app based on something I enjoyed.
2. I wanted to create an app that would be of interest to a user.  
3. I wanted to make sure all the functionalities worked first, then use CSS/Bootstrap to visually make the app come to life.
4. I wanted to make sure what I creatively thought out could be brought to reality in a short amount of time to complete.

 
# Things I could add in the future 

1. better CSS/Bootstrap for visual presentation.
2. a ratings/like/unlike option
3. option for comments from other users on your posts. 
4. a map/location option when creating a post to pinpoint where your location was.
5. option to upload images for posts and profile page.
